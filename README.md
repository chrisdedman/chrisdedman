### Hi y'all and welcome to my GitHub page.ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, I am a Frenchman living in California, USA. 
I am currently self-learning (Started in June 2020) Cisco for getting the CCNA certificate, and Python without any experience or knowledge.

Besides, I am learning English, and I created a blog, for staying motivated in my Networking Journey, and share what am I doing every day and bring, hopefully, some motivations for someone else.
Besides, that's good training for me to write in English (be kind to my mistakes ðŸ˜ƒ ).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on master Python Object-Oriented Programing, and start a Raspberry Pi Robot Car Project with my wife.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and CCNA Certification!
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with any newbie like me who needs helps.
- ðŸ¤” My Python Goal: Create a bot.
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about everything you want to know about me.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [Tweeter](https://twitter.com/DedmanRollet) and [My Blog](https://christechjourney.wordpress.com)
