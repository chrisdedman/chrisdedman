### Hi y'all and welcome to my GitHub page.👋

My name is Chris, I am a Frenchman living in California, USA. 
I am currently learning Cisco for getting the CCNA certificate, and Python without any experience or knowledge.

Besides, I am learning English, and I created a blog, for staying motivated in my Networking Journey, and share what am I doing every day and bring, hopefully, some motivations for someone else.
Besides, that's good training for me to write in English (be kind to my mistakes 😃 ).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on master Python speech recognition and automated my daily life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and CCNA Certification!
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate with any newbie like me who needs helps.
- 🤔 My Python Goal: Create a bot,, automated the network, and learn about ML.
- 💬 You can ask me about everything you want to know about me.
- 📫 You can reach me on [Tweeter](https://twitter.com/DedmanRollet) and [My Blog](https://christechjourney.wordpress.com)
