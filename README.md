### Hello World! Welcome to my GitHub page.ðŸ‘‹

I am Chris. Currently a sophomore in college preparing for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My main programming languages are Python and C++, and I will be learning Java in the winter semester of 2023 (January 2023). I know some HTML and CSS, but not advanced enough (just enough to create my own [website](https://chrisdedman.github.io)). I'm passionate about space and would love to work for any aerospace company. I am preparing to apply for an internship, targeting summer 2023 to advance my programming skills.
