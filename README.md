### Hi y'all and welcome to my GitHub page.ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, I am a Frenchman living in California, USA. 
I am currently learning Cisco for getting the CCNA certificate, and Python without any previous experience or knowledge (started early 2020).

Besides, I am learning English, and I created a blog, for staying motivated in my IT Journey, and share what am I doing and bring, hopefully, some motivations for someone else.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Python Digital Assistant working with google speech recognition.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python / Automation!
- ðŸ¤” My Python Goal: Create a bot, automated the network, and learn about ML.
- ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about everything you want to know about me.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [Tweeter](https://twitter.com/DedmanRollet), on [My Blog](https://christechjourney.wordpress.com) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/christechjourney)
