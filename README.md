### Hello World and welcome to my GitHub page.ðŸ‘‹

I am a Frenchman who immigrate to the United States of America in early 2020, and I am now a permanent resident of California. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I am a former butcher with a 12 years background in this field. I decided to change my path for technology in late 2019 when my wife ~ a Senior Software Engineer~ started to teach me the programming language Python. I have a goal to work for a space company, it has been a dream of mine when I was little but never thought it could be a reality.

* ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, and C++
* ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about everything you want to know about me.
