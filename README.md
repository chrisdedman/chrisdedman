### Hi y'all and welcome to my GitHub page.ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, I am a Frenchman living in California, USA. 
I am currently self-learning (Started in June 2020) Cisco for getting the CCNA certificate, and Python without any experience or knowledge.
Besides, I am learning English.

I created a blog, for staying motivated in my Networkng Journey, and share what am I doing everyday and bring, hopefully, some motivations for someone else.
Besides, that's a good training for me to write in English (be kind with my mistakes ðŸ˜ƒ ).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on master Python Object-Oriented Programing, and start a Raspberry Pi Robot Car Project with my wife.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and CCNA Certification!
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate with any newbie like me who needs helps.
